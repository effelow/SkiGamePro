This is another former Student Project.

The project was assigned in the course 270 CIS Client-side Web Programming at Clarion University of Pennsylvania.

Instructor was Dr. Joseph Wyatt

The main task was to use the HTML canvas to create a game.
The idea was to modify an existing ski game and make it more fun by adding more features

Within our work we added the following:
- more obstacles
- a turbo for skier
- documentation of the .js code
